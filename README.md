# MADLaSR

This is Python script used for controlling the MADLaSR device, which was formerly operated using LabVIEW.

This script is able to run an initial test on a reference sample, in addition to running tests for specular and Lambertian reflectivity. 

Currently, the script operates by writing inputs to the terminal, but hopefully future work will include adding a user-friendly interface for operating the program.
